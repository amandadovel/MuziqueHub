## How it Works üî®
The application uses two seperate API's to retrieve data.
1. TheAudioDB API <br>
*A community Database of audio artwork and data*
```
router.get("/search", (req, res) => {
    const artistName = req.query.artistName.replace(/\s/g, "+");
    let artistData;
    axios.get(`https://www.theaudiodb.com/api/v1/json/${apiKey}/search.php?s=${artistName}`)
        .then(results => results.data.artists.map(result => {
            // === create artist object with original api call data
            let artist = {
                artistId: result.idArtist,
                artistName: result.strArtist,
                label: result.strLabel,
                genre: result.strGenre,
                website: "http://" + result.strWebsite, // concat http:// for link compatability
                facebook: "http://" + result.strFacebook, // concat http:// for link compatability
                twitter: "http://" + result.strTwitter, // concat http:// for link compatability
                biography: result.strBiographyEN,
                country: result.strCountry ,
                artistThumb: result.strArtistThumb ,
                artistLogo: result.strArtistLogo,
                artistFanart: result.strArtistFanart,
                artistFanart2: result.strArtistFanart2,
                artistFanart3: result.strArtistFanart3
            }
            artistData = artist;
            return artistData;
        }))
```

2. SongKick API <br>
*Gives easy access to the biggest live music database in the world*
```
router.get("/search" , (req, res) => {
    const artistName = req.query.artistName.replace(/\s/g, "+");
    axios.get(`https://api.songkick.com/api/3.0/events.json?artist_name=${artistName}&per_page=10&apikey=${apiKey}`)
        .then(results => songkickParse(results))
        .then(mappedResults => res.json(mappedResults))
        .catch(err => res.status(422).json(err));
});
```
